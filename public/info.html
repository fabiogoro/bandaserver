   Open Band is a collective performance, that deals with a contradiction of the social media, that is the apartness of the individual on their devices social media, to propose a collective sound intervention, where the audience through an anonymous chat interface that converts text into sound messages. Through a web site, the audience join an open chat, where each letter is translated into a sound, and the words are played as sound sequences. As people join the conversation, the sound layer becomes more dense and entropic, as the chat is annonimous, people have freedom to type wich leads to several possibilities od unnusual diallogues. The performer works as conductor to the performance, changing between types of sounds, controlling the dynamics and finishing when it's time.
